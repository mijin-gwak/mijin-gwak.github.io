									<h1>ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” (Hello) ðŸ‘‹</h1>
									<p>I'm Mijin, a data enthusiast originally from South Korea<br />
									who made the exciting move to the Netherlands in 2020.<br />
									Since then, I've been on a journey that began with my<br />
									research masterâ€™s degree and evolved into a passion for data.</p>

								<h2>Academic Background</h2>
								<p>My educational path has been a diverse adventure. Armed with a bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature, my academic journey might seem unconventional for data science. However, this background is precisely what sets me apart.</p>
								<p>Within the broad field of English Language and Literature, my primary focus was on cognitive linguisticsâ€”specifically, language acquisition and language processing in the brain. This foundation provided a unique perspective that I carry into the realm of data analysis and engineering.</p>
								<p>This focus on cognitive linguistics has instilled in me a deep understanding of how language shapes our thoughts and actions. It has honed my ability to dissect complex information, a skill that proves invaluable in the world of data where breaking down intricate problems is essential.</p>
								<p>Building upon this seemingly unconventional background, I delved into the world of data during my research master's, exploring the intersection of cognitive linguistics and computational analysis. This interdisciplinary approach allowed me to bring insights from diverse domains, fostering creative problem-solving and a holistic understanding of data challenges.</p>

								<h2>Analytical Expertise</h2>
								<p>My expertise lies in breaking down complex concepts into manageable components and understanding their interconnectednessâ€”a skill set honed through various research projects. This analytical prowess serves as the bedrock for my foray into the world of data engineering. My journey is underscored by a series of Microsoft certifications, including Azure Fundamentals, Power BI Data Analyst Associate, and Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Associate. These certifications attest not only to my proficiency in cloud services but also to my adaptability and eagerness to learn.</p>

								<h2>Effective Communication</h2>
								<p>Beyond analytical acumen, my professional journey as a research assistant and intern has cultivated strong communication skills. Engaging with researchers and stakeholders, I've honed the ability to provide tailored assistance by identifying unique needs and communicating effectively. Whether navigating complex concepts, addressing research ethics, or managing budgetary constraints, I approach each interaction with empathy and a positive attitude. My strong emotional intelligence fosters trust and harmony, creating an environment conducive to collaboration.</p>

								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>Beyond the data-driven realms, I find joy in various activities. Fitness is an integral part of my routine, as I believe in the positive impact of a healthy body on overall well-being. Tennis is another passion of mineâ€”a fantastic blend of exercise and social interaction. Additionally, I have a keen interest in cooking. Driven by curiosity, I love experimenting with different recipes and ingredients, turning the kitchen into my canvas for culinary exploration.</p>
								
								<h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
								<p>I'm excited to share my data analysis and engineering endeavors with you. Explore my portfolio to gain insights into my projects, skills, and the evolving tapestry of my professional journey. If you have any questions or would like to chat about data, technology, or anything in between, feel free to reach out. I'm always up for a conversation!</p>
